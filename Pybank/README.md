## Financial Analysis with Python

This repository contains a Python script (main.py) for conducting financial analysis on a dataset containing profit/loss data over a period of time. Additionally, it includes a CSV file (budget_data.csv) for the analysis.

## Overview

The Python script performs the following financial analysis:

Total Months: Calculates the total number of months included in the dataset.

Net Total Amount of Profit/Losses: Computes the sum of all profit/loss values over the entire period.

Average Change in Profit/Losses: Determines the average change in profit/losses over the entire period.

Greatest Increase in Profits: Identifies the date and amount of the greatest increase in profits observed during the period.

Greatest Decrease in Profits: Identifies the date and amount of the greatest decrease in profits observed during the period.

## Getting Started

To run the financial analysis script, follow these steps:

Clone this repository to your local machine:
git clone <repository_url>

Navigate to the directory containing the Python script and the CSV file:
cd Pybank

Run the Python script:
python main.py

View the analysis results printed to the terminal and exported to a text file named "financial_analysis.txt" in the "analysis" folder.
